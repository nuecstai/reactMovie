## Production Build

### Android APK

A production-ready APK is available in the `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/` directory.

**Pre-built APK**: `app-release.apk` (~71.7 MB)

To build your own production APK:

1. **Set up environment variables**: Ensure your `.env` file contains all required API keys

2. **Configure for production**: Inject environment variables into the app configuration:
   ```bash
   node scripts/configure-env.js
   ```

3. **Generate a signing keystore** (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   cd android/app
   keytool -genkeypair -v -storetype PKCS12 -keystore my-upload-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
   ```

4. **Build the production APK**:
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```

5. **Reset configuration** (optional, keeps source code clean):
   ```bash
   git checkout app.json
   ```

6. The APK will be generated at: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

> **üîí Security Note**: The production APK contains real API keys (required for functionality), while the source code uses placeholder values for security. This is the correct and secure approach for mobile app distribution.

### Installation

- Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in your Android device settings
- Transfer the APK file to your device
- Install the APK by tapping on it
